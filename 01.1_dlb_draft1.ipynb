    "## Deep learning for image recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the details of exactly _how_ deep learning works, let's explore it through an example. In this exercise, we will use a pre-trained deep learning model, [ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), which has been trained on [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/), a collection of about 1.3 million images labeled as being in one of 1,000 categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help with this exercise, let us introduce you to Amelia. <img alt='A GAN-generated cartoon image of Amelia, our character for this exercise.' src='images/amelia.png' align='right' width=300 style=\"float: right; padding: 10px 0px 0px 10px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Amelia, our teenaged, tech-geek heroine, happens to be an extremely picky eater. She's something of a pizza fanatic 🍕. When dinner time rolls around, she only wants to come down from her bedroom if pizza is on the menu. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being a tech-geek, Amelia has installed a hidden camera in the dining room.  Once dinner is set, the camera snaps a photo of the meal.  Now, she wants to develop an AI image recognition system to determine if pizza is served or not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's help Amelia code her pizza recognition system!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> &#x1F4DD; As a sidenote, the drawing of Amelia was generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on Anime images and created at: [https://thisanimedoesnotexist.ai/](https://thisanimedoesnotexist.ai/).

    "With her pizza-recognizing hidden camera, she's already completed Step 1: Choose a Problem! Due to the flexible nature of coding, implementing the next six steps will jump around a bit. Don't worry though, Amelia knows her stuff and will make sure we know where we're at in the application process. Here's the overiew of the steps in the application development process and how the correspond to the code in this Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "1. Choose a Problem - Making a pizza-recognizer!\n",
    "2. Gather Good Data - Amelia is just a teenager, she can't afford to take thousands of images of pizza! Instead she's going to use a model that's already been trained to \"recognize\" pizza.\n",
    "3. Clean and Prep Data - The model she's using already has training on pizza, so she doesn't need to worry about prepping her training data. She'll have to do a bit of work to make sure that her new inputs are formatted correctly, however.\n",
    "4. Choose a Model - Amelia needs a model that's already trained (she can't go get the training data on her own) and one that recognizes images. That narrows her search to models like ResNet.\n",
    "5. Train the Model - Our heroine is going to use a model that's pre-trained so... Done! She's up and running with an AI application without needing to compile or train anything. Magic!\n",
    "6. Evalute the Model - As part of the evaluation process, Amelia is going to need to test the model to see how well it recognizes pizza.\n",
    "7. Deploy the Model - Since Amelia is comfortable using Jupyter Notebooks, she's going to leave the application here. Embedding the model in another application is uneccesary (and beyond the scope of this course!)\n",
